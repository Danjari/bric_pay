# Task ID: 5
# Title: Transfer Funds API Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the POST /transfer endpoint for peer-to-peer fund transfers between accounts.
# Details:
Create endpoint that accepts from_account, to_account, and amount, validates both accounts exist, checks sufficient balance, performs atomic transfer (debit sender, credit receiver), creates transaction records, and returns transfer confirmation.

# Test Strategy:
Test successful transfers, insufficient balance scenarios, non-existent accounts, and verify atomicity of transactions.
