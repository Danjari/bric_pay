# Task ID: 3
# Title: Account Creation API Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the POST /create-account endpoint for user registration and account creation.
# Details:
Create endpoint that accepts user data (name, surname, phone, password, date_of_birth, place_of_birth), validates input, hashes password with bcrypt, generates unique 10-12 digit account number, stores user in database, and returns account number and initial balance (0).

# Test Strategy:
Test with valid and invalid inputs, verify password hashing, account number generation, duplicate phone number handling, and proper response format.
